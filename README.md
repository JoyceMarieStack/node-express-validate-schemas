# Simple Node Express to Validate Schemas

This has been built using boilerplate code from ChatGPT.

My main intention was to use ChatGPT to build a boilerplate JSON Schema for designing an API response.

4 hours later, hereâ€™s what I achieved:

Outcomes Achieved

- Created a JSON Schema for a paginated API response of Article data based on https://schema.org/Article

- Used ChatGPT to generate boilerplate code for a Node app using Express and EJS templates.

- Added a file upload option for OpenAPI files

- Used ChatGPT to debug some errors

- Used Ajv to validate against the generated JSON Schema

- The app outputs success or errors to the screen

```
 npm install
 npm start

```
